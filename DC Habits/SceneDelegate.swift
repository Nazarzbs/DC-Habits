        //In the WWDC talk, the presenter uses applicationDidEnterBackground in the app delegate instead of the Scene Delegate to schedule the background task. applicationDidEnterBackground is the old API for the old lifecycle of apps prior to iOS 13. In iOS 13, I wasnâ€™t able to get my app to call that delegate method at all, so we needed to use the scene delegate instead
